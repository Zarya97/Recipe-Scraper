Smoky bacon, shallots and herbs round out the dish to create a vibrant and satisfying side.	Easy	-1	-1	-1	-1	6 to 8 servings	2 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and sliced 1/4 inch thick__Kosher salt__4 slices thick-cut bacon, roughly chopped__3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil__2 large shallots, chopped__3 tablespoons white wine vinegar__1 tablespoon grainy mustard__1 teaspoon sugar__Freshly ground pepper__1/2 cup chopped fresh chives__1/4 cup chopped fresh dill	Put the potatoes in a large saucepan; cover with cold water and season with 1 teaspoon salt. Bring to a simmer and cook until tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and transfer to a large bowl.__Meanwhile, cook the bacon in a medium nonstick skillet over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until crisp, about 10 minutes. Remove the bacon to a paper towel-lined plate using a slotted spoon. Pour the drippings into a small bowl and wipe out the skillet.__Return the skillet to medium heat and add the olive oil and 2 tablespoons of the reserved drippings. Add the shallots and cook, stirring, until softened, about 4 minutes. Whisk in 2 tablespoons each vinegar and water, the mustard and sugar. Bring to a simmer.__Pour the warm dressing over the potatoes; season with 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper and toss. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon vinegar, the chives, dill and bacon; toss again. Serve warm.

(If the towel is too wet, the dough will get sticky.) Working quickly so the dough doesn't dry out, place one sheet of phyllo on a board, brush lightly with melted butter, and sprinkle lightly with bread crumbs. Place a second sheet of phyllo on top, brush with melted butter, and sprinkle with bread crumbs. Continue until you have 4 sheets stacked up. Cut the sheets in half crosswise to make 2 almost-squares.__Cut one of the goat cheeses in half horizontally, making 2 thin discs. Place each disc in the center of one phyllo square. Starting at one corner, fold the phyllo up over the cheese and continue folding and pleating the phyllo around the cheese, as though you're wrapping a round gift that's tied on top. You will end with extra phyllo dough on top; twist the excess into a topknot. Brush the discs all over with melted butter and place on a sheet pan lined with parchment paper. Continue with the remaining phyllo dough and 2 goat cheese discs to make 4 additional packages.__Bake for 20 minutes, until the phyllo is lightly browned. Allow to cool for 5 minutes.__While the cheese packages bake, place the salad greens in a large bowl. Whisk the vinegar, mustard, garlic, salt, and pepper together in a small bowl. Still whisking, slowly add the olive oil, making an emulsion. Toss the salad greens with enough vinaigrette to moisten.__Distribute the salad among 6 plates and place one warm goat cheese package in the center of each plate. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and serve.
